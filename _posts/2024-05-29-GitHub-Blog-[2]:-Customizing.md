[Github Blog [1]: Using Jekyll](https://rebedy.github.io/posts/Github-Blog-1-Using-Jekyll/)


            


            


                        


            


            



## Customizing Jekyll Chirpy Theme


---



### 1. Initializing ‘Chirpy Theme’



{% raw %}
```bash
./tools/init.sh
```
{% endraw %}


- This process will do …
	- remove `.travis.yml`
	- remove files under `_posts`
	- delete .hook from `.github/workflows/pages-deploy.yml.hook`
	- delete other folders and files in .github
	- delete `Gemfile.lock` from .gitignore
	- automatically generate commits to save changes

            


            



### 2. Dependencies



{% raw %}
```bash
bundle
```
{% endraw %}



            


            



### 3. Chirpy Environment Settings



#### source code guide

- `_config.yml`: The blog’s basic configuration. Basic environment settings.
- `_data`: You can change the configuration of the sidebar and post sharing buttons. Depending on your language settings, you can change the words by default.
- `_include`: You can change the UI inserted into most modules such as sidebar, ToC, Google Analytics, footer, and comments.
- `_layout`: You can change the basic format applied throughout the blog, the format applied to categories, posts, etc.
- `_posts`: This saves the created posts.
- `_sass`: To customize css files.
- `_site`: Everything that makes up the screen UI when running locally. Changes made here will be reflected locally, but will not be uploaded to GitHub. Also, if you change the contents of other basic directories and build, the contents here will change.
- `_tabs`: Landing page for the sidebar's default tab menus.
- `assets`: css, img, etc. Images to be included in the post are placed under `assets/img/favicon`. You can create a Favicon [here](https://realfavicongenerator.net/).
- `tools`: Code for automatic deployment on github. Just don't touch it at all.
